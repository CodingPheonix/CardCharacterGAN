# CardCharacterGAN
 An exploration into AI GAN for the production of specialised character art

Using card databases from pokemon and yugioh
UPDATE: yugioh database varies too drastically and so does pokemon database
-- Solution:
Train classifier AIs to remove unstable data, (very picky --> doesn't keep most, very specialised so as to have good data) potentially allow this classifier to seperate by different colour schemes to train the GAN on different aspects of the charaters. Especially useful for pokemon, as the spreadsheet provided lists the type which corellates heavily with the colour scheme used, this could allow for an option in the final product to include different aspects/types when generating cards.

Current Status: Vetting Dataset
